The code is about transistent temperature calculation using implicit scheme by finite difference method.
Calculation domain is 2d with uniform square mesh.
Jacobi iteration is used for the cauculation of the temperature field at the next time step.
The data for 2d is reshaped to one dimensional array for Jacobi iteration like AX=B.
Dirichlet boundary condition is used for bounday value setting at four boundary nodes.
