# Hands-on-tutorial-for-finite-difference-method
Basic code for numerical calculation of PDE using finite difference method with simple code implementation and a brief illustration
Code about numerical calculation for PDE, like heat transfer and fluid flow problem, using FDM
Different solver like implicit scheme using Jacobi iteration and Others will be add to the code
Various parallelization methods, like MPI and CUDA will be implemented to accelearte the numerical calculation
